// CSC-331 Expense Tracker Group Project


//          Project ideas:
// Make a button that add a new expense, have a category, and how much the expense is
// Have a monthly/daily/weekly view of expenses, as well as a budget for that time period
// Display expenses in a list format based on the time period
// (If possible) make a circle display of categories
// Use JSON to save, serialize, and deserialize information to a java file



// Sam : GUI/ display of project
// Serialization through java
// Braedon: Classes / methods for making expense tracker work
// Mason: Make sure buttons interact with class code properly


// For presentation: Prepare a short presentation with code from each of our parts explaining
// what it does, and then run the program and show the class
